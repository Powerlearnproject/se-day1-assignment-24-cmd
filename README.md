Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-software engineering isthe systematic application of engineering principle and,methodsand tools to development and maintenance of high quality software systems
-its importance in the technology industry is that it plays a role by enabling the creation of software application and systems that power various aspects of modern life including communication , commerce, entertainment and health care 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.the development of programming language eg fotran,c
2.the establishing of software engineering as a displine 
3.therise of agile methodologies 
4.the advert of structured programming 
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirement-this is gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements 
2.Design-creating high level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface 
3.Implementation-building and writing codes according to the specifications
4.Testing-conducting various test to ensure the software meets quality standarards and functional requirements 
5.Deployment-the releasing the software to the users
6.Maintainance-providing ongoing support 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-waterfall approaches with distinct phase flowing downward like a waterfall eg requirements design and implementation while Agile methodologies iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.software developer is responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions 
2.Assurance Engineer,ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
3.project manager,oversees the planning , execution and delivery of software systems 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provides comprehensive tool of writing , debugging and testing codes eg intellij IDEA
VCS provides tool for tracking changes to source codes and coodinating work among team members eg Git, subversion 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.channging requirements -requirements may change during the development cycle
2.Tight deadlines-
3.Technical debt
-strateito overcome this challenges are; effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritizing of the task,and regular reassessment of project goals and time lines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. unit-testing individual components 
2. integration -testing interactions between different components or subsystems 
3. system -testing the entire software as a whole
4. acceptance -testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
-their importance in  software quality assurance is quality control measures 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-this is all about crafting questions or statements inorder to get the best tesponce from the AI
-its importance is that it prevents getting confusing answers 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
if you ask AI to tell you about county it will tend to give a general answer but when you specify to it tell mie about laikipia county it will try to explain more about the laikipia county
